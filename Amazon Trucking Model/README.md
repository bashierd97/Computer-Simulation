## Simulation of an discrete event model similar to the Queue Server System. This time the model runs simulation experiments with an Amazon Trucking Model. 
### A 50% pobability of service is implemented, and a probabilistic serve time is uniformly distributed between 0.5 and 3 days based on a continuous scale.

The model is ran 10,000 times each for 1 facility and 2 facilities for 20 days. Output graphs of PDF's & CDF's will be generated for the resultant costs. Average waiting time and resource utilization will also output for each option.
