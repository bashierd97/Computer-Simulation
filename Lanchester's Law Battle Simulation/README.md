### These programs evaluate battle effectiveness options. A continous battle simulation based on Lanchester's Law for aimed fire. Euler's Integration Method will integrate the differential equations over time, simulating the troops "firing" continously at one another.

- The first program will simulate two armies, WITH NO reinforcements, battling. (User may select amount of troops for each side and the lethality coefficient for each side)

- The second program will simulate two armies,  WITH reinforcements, battling. (User selects same things as first program but this time, is also capable of adding
instantaneous pulses of reinforcements. Each reinforcement may have a different lethality coefficient ascribed to the new troops. User decided when reinforcements enter the battle
AND reinforcement size compared to initial force level).
